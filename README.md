# Backblaze B2 + Twelve Labs Media Asset Management Example

'CatTube' is a simple media asset management app comprising: 

* A web app implemented with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and JavaScript.
* Video uploading with [Uppy](https://uppy.io) and processing at [TransloadIt](https://transloadit.com/).
* Cloud object storage at [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html).
* Video understanding by [Twelve Labs](https://www.twelvelabs.io/)

## User Experience

### Video Upload

* Users upload videos from their browser to TransloadIt via the Uppy widget on the web app's 'Upload Video' page.

* Once the video is uploaded, a JavaScript front end in the browser polls an API at the web app, monitoring its status.

* A Huey task polls TransloadIt until the upload is complete, when it updates the video's database record with the name of the uploaded file.

* The next call from the JavaScript front end will return with the name of the uploaded video, signalling that the upload operation is complete. The browser shows the uploaded video, ready for viewing.

### Indexing Videos

* A user selects one or more videos in the web app, and hits the **Index** button.

* The JavaScript front end sends the list of videos to an API in the web app.

* The web app's index API starts a Huey task that creates a Twelve Labs index task for each video, then polls for the status of each video until all are ready.

## Prerequisites

* An internet-accessible host
* [Python 3.9.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/) (other Python versions _may_ work) and `pip`
* A Backblaze account. [Sign up here](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/sign-up.html?referrer=nopref).
* A TransloadIt account. [Sign up here](https://transloadit.com/c/signup/).
* A Twelve Labs account. [Sign up here](https://playground.twelvelabs.io/).

## Backblaze B2

Click **Buckets** in the navigation menu on the left, then **Create a Bucket**. Give the bucket a name (you may need more than one try, the bucket name must be globally unique!), leave the remaining settings, and click **Create a Bucket**. Make a note of the **Endpoint** shown in the bucket details; it's a domain name of the form `s3.us-west-004.backblazeb2.com`. Make a note also of the region portion of the endpoint; this is the string following `s3.` and preceding `.backblazeb2.com`. In the example above, it's `us-west-004`, but yours may be different.

You'll be creating three Application Keysâ€“one each for bunny.net, TransloadIt and the web application. Why three keys? The three B2 clients need different levels of access: bunny.net only needs to read files to cache and deliver them; TransloadIt only needs to write raw and processed files; the web app needs read/write access, but only to files with the `static/` prefix - Django's `collectstatic` command uploads new and updated assets such as CSS files and images with this prefix. 

Click **App Keys** in the left nav menu, then **Add a New Application Key**. Name the key `read-only-key-for-bunny`, select the bucket you just created, select **Read Only** and **Allow List All Bucket Names**, and click **Create New Key**. Make careful note of the key - you will not be able to retrieve it after navigating away from the page!

Now click **Add a New Application Key** a second time and name the key `write-only-key-for-transloadit`. Select your bucket, **Write Only** and **Allow List All Bucket Names**, and click **Create New Key**. Again, make careful note of the key!

Add a third Application Key, named `read-write-key-for-video-app`, with **Read and Write** access to the bucket you just created, and **Allow List All Bucket Names**. One more time, copy that key somewhere safe!

## TransloadIt

You can create a new App, or use an existing one, as you see fit.

Click **Credentials** in the navigation menu on the left, then, under **Third-party Credentials** click **Add new Credential**. Select **Backblaze** as the service, name the key `backblaze-write-only`, and paste in the Backblaze B2 Bucket name, Application Key ID and Application Key. Click **Save**.

Now click **Templates** in the left nav menu, then **New Template**. Click **Blank** to create an empty template. Give the template a suitable name and paste in the [assembly instructions](assembly-instructions.json). Feel free to replace the `watermark_url` and otherwise customize the template! Click **Create Template** and copy the template id displayed at the top of the page.

Finally, to secure access to your template, click **Settings** in the left nav menu and, under **API Settings**, enable **Require a correct Signature**. The web application contains code to generate a unique signature for each file upload.

## Web Application

### Installation

Clone this repository onto the host, `cd` into the local repository directory, then use `pip install` to install dependencies for the components as required:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:backblaze-b2-samples/b2-transloadit-example.git
cd b2-transloadit-example
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Copy `.env.template` to `.env`, or set environment variables with your configuration:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "<Your Backblaze Application Key ID>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "<Your Backblaze Application Key>"
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "<Your Backblaze Bucket>"
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "<Your Backblaze endpoint region, e.g. us-west-004>"

BUNNY_PULL_ZONE_DOMAIN = "<Your bunny.net Pull Zone domain, e.g. example-movies.b-cdn.net>"

TRANSLOADIT_KEY = "<Your TransloadIt Auth Key>"
TRANSLOADIT_SECRET = "<Your TransloadIt Auth Secret>"
TRANSLOADIT_TEMPLATE_ID = "<Your TransloadIt Template ID>"

WEB_APPLICATION_HOST = "<Your web application's domain, e.g. movies.example.com>"
```

Run the usual commands to initialize a Django application:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Run the Web App

To start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You may provide the runserver command with the interface and port to which the web app should bind. For example, to
listen on the standard HTTP port on all interfaces, you would use:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
```

## Caveats

Note that this is an example system! To run a similar system in production, you would need to make several changes,
including running the app from a WSGI server such as [Green Unicorn](http://gunicorn.org/)
  or [Apache Web Server](https://httpd.apache.org) with [`mod_wsgi`](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi).

Feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request if you make an interesting change!

_The web application is based on the [Backblaze B2 Video Sharing Example](https://github.com/backblaze-b2-samples/b2-video-sharing-example), which in turn was originally forked from the 
excellent [simple-s3-setup](https://github.com/sibtc/simple-s3-setup) by [sibtc](https://github.com/sibtc/)_.
